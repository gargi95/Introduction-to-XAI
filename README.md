# Intro to Explainable AI (XAI) 🔍

Welcome to the **Intro to Explainable AI (XAI)** repository! This project focuses on understanding and implementing explainability methods in machine learning and deep learning models.
## 📖 Overview

Explainable AI (XAI) is a critical area of AI research that aims to make complex machine learning models more transparent, interpretable, and accountable. In this repository, we explore various XAI techniques to shed light on model decisions and enhance understanding for end users.

This repository includes:
- **Post hoc explanation methods** for machine learning models.
- Datasets and tools for experimentation, including preprocessing and feature extraction techniques.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Pandas
