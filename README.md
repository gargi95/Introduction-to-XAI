# Intro to Explainable AI (XAI) üîç

Welcome to the **Intro to Explainable AI (XAI)** repository! This project focuses on understanding and implementing explainability methods in machine learning and deep learning models.
## üìñ Overview

Explainable AI (XAI) is a critical area of AI research that aims to make complex machine learning models more transparent, interpretable, and accountable. In this repository, we explore various XAI techniques to shed light on model decisions and enhance understanding for end users.

This repository includes:
- **Post hoc explanation methods** for machine learning models.
- Datasets and tools for experimentation, including preprocessing and feature extraction techniques.

### Explanation:
1. **Table of Papers**: The table under "Collection of Papers" lists key papers related to XAI, with columns for the title, venue, and year.
2. **Structure**: The table is added as a simple markdown table for easy readability and to encourage further contributions to the list.
3. **Customization**: Feel free to replace the example papers with the actual papers that are relevant to your repository. You can also add more papers over time.

This should now provide a professional and structured README file that covers both your project and a list of reference papers. Let me know if you need any more adjustments!
